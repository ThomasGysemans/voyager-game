# Voyager Game

A 2D game made in Godot for you to explore the solar system in your spaceship. Learn stuff as you go near the planets. But be careful, pressing the space key might have unexpected result... See by yourself ;)

Move using the arrow keys.

This game is playable by anyone, but the explanatory texts are written in French. For now, an English version is not planned as it is just a training game I've made. I plan on doing much more as I learn.
